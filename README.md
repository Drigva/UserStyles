# UserStyles

## 1. General Uses
### 1.1 [Fix Print Orientation](https://github.com/Drigva/UserStyles/tree/main/fix-print-orientation)
A userstyle that sets the page size to automatic for printing web pages, improving compatibility with Chrome's print window when using the printer's default settings. This is especially useful for addressing issues with the absence of the "Landscape" option in Chrome's print window, based on a solution provided by Peter Ajamian in a Google Chrome support thread.

## 2. Notion
### 2.1 [Customizable Divider](https://github.com/Drigva/UserStyles/raw/refs/heads/main/Notion/Notion-Custom-Divider.user.css):
Fully customizable dividers for Notion. Adjust thickness, line style (solid/dashed/dotted), color to match your workspace aesthetic.
